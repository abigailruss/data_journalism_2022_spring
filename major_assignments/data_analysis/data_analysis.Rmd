#Loading Data
```{r}
census_data <- read_csv("data/census_incarceration.csv")
```
The data doesn't seem to need any cleaning. Will re-evaluate as we do more explanation, but all the numbers, titles, and labels seem explanatory and consistent.

#Analysis of the data
The data has 3,211 rows and 9 columns. Each county for every state has the total population and incarcerated population for 2020, 2010 and 2000, and its FIPS code.
